Screen Sharing Web Application
Project Overview
In the current era, especially given the rise of remote work due to the pandemic, screen sharing has become an essential tool for communication and collaboration. To address this demand, Iâ€™ve developed a Screen Sharing Web Application using Node.js. This application aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to share their screens in real-time, similar to well-known tools like TeamViewer.
